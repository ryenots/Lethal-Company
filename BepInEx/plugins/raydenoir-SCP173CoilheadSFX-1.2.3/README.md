## Installation

Just put the /BepInEx/ folder inside your /steamapps/common/Lethal Company/ folder after installing all the dependecies. (It doesn't mess up or delete your files, just copies the mod folder inside your plugins.)

## Config

Generated after launching the game for the first time.

EnableDefaultMovementSounds = true/false - If set to true, reverts mod concrete grinding sounds on move.

EnableDefaultSpringSounds = true/false - If set to true, reverts mod scare sounds back to spring noises.

## Roadmap

Watch your back.

Planning to enhance moving sounds, make more config fields, and create scare sounds delay.

Join my discord! I would be delighted to hear any silly mod ideas.
