# Metal Recharging
Allows you to recharge any metal object in a realistic way. It's probably fine.

It's highly recommended, but not explicitly required, that everybody on the server has this mod installed.

As long as the host and the player attempting to charge have the mod installed, it will work. But there may be unintended side effects.
