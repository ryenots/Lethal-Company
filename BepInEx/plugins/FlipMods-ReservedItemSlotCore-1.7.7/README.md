# ReservedItemSlotCore
<strong>The core mod for all ReservedItemSlot mods.</strong><br>
This mod is required for my ReservedItemSlot mods to work, such as ReservedFlashlightSlot and ReservedWalkieSlot.<br>
These mods will give you free dedicated inventory slots for their respective item(s). These slots will be shown on the right side of your screen, stacking vertically.<br><br>

You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them. (patch 1.2.1)<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.<br><br>

Grabbing reserved items, as well as switching between the main hotbar and reserved hotbar slots should sync between clients using this mod. (patch 1.2.5)<br>
If relevant, these mods will have dedicated keybinds to activate the items without needing to have them currently selected.<br><br>

<strong>New as of patch 1.7.2, all clients running this core mod will sync with the host, and have the same reserved item slots as them, regardless of which of the reserved item slot mods they have installed.</strong><br>
Using reserved item slots from the host for mods that you don't have should not cause issues, but you will not benefit from their extra mod features, such as specific hotkeys for reserved items, and you won't see these reserved items on players while they are not currently held.<br>
This may change, or be adjusted in the future, but it's currently in place to try and keep everyone's inventory the same size to help with syncing.<br>
This can also help with sending custom reserved item slots to other clients from the host if I do end up adding functionality to create them in the config, or if I end up creating a ReservedCustomItemSlot mod, which would be a server-side mod.<br>

## Mod compatibility
+ HotbarPlus is compatible!
+ LethalThings Utility Belt is now compatible!
+ Other mods that can add hotbar slots are not guaranteed to work.
+ Other mods that might re-arrange the hotbar slots (HUD) are not guaranteed to play nicely with these mods, but <i>might</i> technically work.

## Referencing this mod
I do apologize, but this mod wasn't built around the idea that others would be able to create their own ReservedItemSlot mods.<br>
The main reason is that I often restructure this core mod, and as a result, I would likely be breaking many references and compatibility with other ReservedItemSlot mods not made by me, and I don't like doing that to people.<br>
Maybe in the near future I'll take the time to restructure it to a point where I don't think I will have to edit the core mod, but only time will tell.<br>
If there is a ReservedItemSlot mod that you would like, feel free to shoot me a request on the Lethal Company Modding discord.<br>
Or if you do want to make your own ReservedItemSlot mod, also let me know in the discord and we can talk about it!<br>
