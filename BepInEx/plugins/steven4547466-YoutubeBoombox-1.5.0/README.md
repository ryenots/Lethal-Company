YoutubeBoombox allows you to play any youtube video you want directly from in game.

As long as the host has the mod, the song will sync to everyone with the mod. Players without the mod will not hear anything.

This plugin will download ffmpeg and ytdl for you.

The audio is synced, but everyone has to download it, and it won't start until everyone has it downloaded.

How to use:
1. Obtain boombox
2. Use your configured hotkey to open the boombox menu (B by default)
3. Paste URL
4. Click play
5. Wait a few seconds for everyone to download
6. Profit.

Features:
- Play music from youtube and sync to all clients as long as everyone has the mod
- Client side boombox volume control
  - Type `/bbv number` to change the volume of the closest boombox on your client within 15m
    - If you are holding a boombox, the command will always target that one
    - Example: `/bbv 50` is half as loud
- Supports basic `youtube.com/watch` links and shortened `youtu.be` links
- Supports playlist links like `youtube.com/playlist?list=LIST_ID` ensure there's no `v=` in there, otherwise it'll play just the single video
- Retains downloads until you restart the game, meaning playing the same songs in the same session only needs to download once, making repeats faster
