# Needy Cats v1.0.2
### <i>You like cats? The company likes cats too! Find them roaming the various abandoned facilities and bring them home*!</i>
##
###
Ever wanted to bring felines into Lethal Company? It is now possible with this mod! You will see cats that roam around, meow <b>(loudly, be careful!)</b> and sit down when they feel safe. <br> Make sure to pet them regularly, otherwise they may attract unwanted guests with their noise.

The spawn rate of cats is configurable (default to 20) and the host can change names.txt to modify the pool of available cat names.

<sub>*The company pledges not to harm the cats.</sub>

## Known issues
- Picking up and dropping a cat during the takeoff or landing phase may leave them stuck in place and possibly lost forever.
- Some screen effects make the cats see through.
